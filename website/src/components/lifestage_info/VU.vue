            During High School, I developed a strong interest in the inner workings of the human brain during my biology classes.
            This interest led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam where i was initially captivated by the field of neuroscience.
            As I progressed through my studies, I discovered an interest in statistics and programming, which led me to focus on research methods and data analysis.

        <p>
           During my third year, I chose the Brain and Genestics track, this track has a strong focus on quantitative research methods in the field of behavioural genetics and neuroscience.
           My interest primarily lay with behavioural genetics (research field focussing on the role of genetics in behaviour) and I wrote my thesis at the vue biological psychology department.
           Which was awarded the best bachelor thesis of the pyschology department of my cohort <a href="https://github.com/RoelHuijskens/website2.0/blob/37d00e2c443ff844e6d71d43bb1a5f5f08eb85b7/website/src/assets/docs/Bachelor_thesis_certificate.pdf">certificate</a>, and was used as a basis of a published <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-020-10035-7">paper</a>.
