            During High School, I developed a strong interest in the inner workings of the human brain during my biology classes.
            This led me to pursue a bachelor's degree in psychology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, where i was initially captivated by the field of neuroscience.
            As I progressed through my studies, I discovered an growing interest in statistics and programming, which ultimately led me to focus on research methods and data analysis.

        <p>
           During my third year, I chose the Brain and Genetics track, which focuses heavily on quantitative research methods in behavioral genetics and neuroscience.
           My primary interest was in behavioural genetics, a field that explores the role of genetics in behavior. I wrote my thesis at the VU Biological Psychology Department,
           which was awarded the best bachelor thesis of the pyschology department of my cohort (see: <u><a href="https://github.com/RoelHuijskens/website2.0/blob/37d00e2c443ff844e6d71d43bb1a5f5f08eb85b7/website/src/assets/docs/Bachelor_thesis_certificate.pdf">certificate</a></u>).
           My thesis also served as the basis for a published <u><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-020-10035-7">paper</a></u>.
