        <h3>2021-now</h3>
        <p>
            After my studies I started working as a Devops engineer at APG Asset Management.
            In this role, I support our business with data analytics tooling such as Posit, R, Python.
            This involves both consulting our business on how to develop and deploy Python/R/Alteryx applications and help maintaining our infrastructure.
            During this time, I have strongly developed my technical skills and have learned a lot about the inner workings of a large financial institution.
            I get the most satisfaction from my work when I can help our portfolio managers with their data problems and helping them develop better technical skills.
