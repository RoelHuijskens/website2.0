            After my bachelor's studies, I wanted to further develop my skills in statistics and data analysis.
            I chose to pursue a master's degree in Applied Statistics at Utrecht University.
            This selective porgram provided me with a strong foundation in statistical theory and practical data analysis skills.
            During my studies and thesis internship, I found myself further interested in the more technical aspects of machine learning and programming.

        <p>
           During my master's program, I chose to do my thesis internship at Statistics Netherlands (CBS).
           Alongside my thesis, I completed the EMOS program, an extracurricular program that focused on applying statistical methods for national statistics.
           My thesis focused on the problem of sample matching, a method to utilize data from non-probability samples in official statistics.
