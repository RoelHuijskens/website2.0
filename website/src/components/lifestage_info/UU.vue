            After my bachelor studies, I wanted to further develop my skills in statistics and data analysis. 
            I chose to pursue a Master's degree in Applied Statistics at Utrecht Universiteit.
            This selective porgram provided me with a strong foundation in statistical theory and practical skills in data analysis.
            During my studies and thesis internship, I found myself further interested in the more technical aspects of machine learning and programming.

        <h2>Thesis</h2>
        <p>
           During my Master's, I chose to do my thesis internship at Statistics Netherlands (CBS). 
           Alongside my thesis, I completed the EMOS program, an extracurricular program that focuses on the application of statistical methods for national statistics.
           My thesis focussed on the problem of sample matching, a method to utilize data from non-probability samples in official statistics.
