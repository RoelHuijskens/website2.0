# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This is a place where I showcase my projects, and share some info about myself!

## Code Usage

All the code on this website is free to be copied and utilized for your own branding. Whether you want to use it as a reference or incorporate it into your own projects, go ahead and make the most of it!

## Under Construction

Please note that this website is still under construction. I am continuously working on improving its design and functionality. Stay tuned for updates and new features!

## Getting Started

### Frontend

To start the frontend of this website, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the frontend directory (website).
4. Run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the frontend development server and you can access the website in your browser.

Subsequently this site can also be built using:

```
npm run build
```

Which will add the raw js/css/html in the app/frontend_dist directory.


### Backend

To start the backend of this website, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `app` directory.
3. Run the following command:

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the backend server using Uvicorn with automatic reloading enabled. The server will listen for incoming requests and handle them accordingly.

Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed before running the command. You can install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the `app` directory.

Once the backend server is running, you can interact with the website's API endpoints and test its functionality.


## Testing

The backend tests have been written with pytest, and can be started via:

```
pytest tests
```
