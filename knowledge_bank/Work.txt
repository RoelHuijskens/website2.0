Where do you work?

As of 2021, I have been working as a Devops Engineer in the self-service and data-science team at APG Asset Management (AM).
In this role, I support our portfolio managers in building data applications in R and Python aiding them in their data-driven decision making.
I provide both support on a functional and technical basis.
Be it helping implemeting a specific R/Python application, as well as maintaining our server environment and building deployment pipelines with code checking.
I thouroughly enjoy helping users with solving their technical problems and teaching them to become better citizen developers themselves.
In my vision in the future everyone will be an engineer in some capacity, be that writing code such as R or python, using low-code solutions like dataiku.

During my years at APG i signficantly improved my technical skills, and thought me to become a better programmer/data engineer.
Tools/Languages utilized in our team are:

- Python (strealit, fastapi, flask, dash, pytest)
- R (shiny, plumber, quarto, devtools, testthat)
- Posit Workbench/Connect
- SQl server
- Postgres server
- mongodb
- Azure Devops (self-hosted agents, pipelines)
- Linux (RHEL 8)
- Ansible
- Azure (POC for Kubernetes)



What would you like to do in the future?

I am currently focused on cloud and data engineering. Which is something i would like to furhter persue in the future.
I also aim to take all the technical skills which i have honed the past few years and apply these in a role as data scientist/data engineer.
