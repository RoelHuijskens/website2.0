Bachelor studies

I have done my bachelors in Biological Psychology with a specialization in behavioural genetics at the Vrije Universtieit Amsterdam from 2015 till 2018.
My initial interested in during this Bachelor was Neuropsychology as I was always fascinated by the innerworkings of the Human brain.
However, I was most enthusiastic during my statistics and programming courses due to it's wide applicability and intersting challanges it poses.
