Hobbies:

What do i enjoy doing?

I enjoy programming, working out, cycling, walking on the beach, listening to music, playing games and watching movies. 


Working out
My favourite workout excercises are squats and bench press. 
I try to workout 4-5 days per week as this is a great time to unwind and relax.
I used to be an avid runner, but now I have switched to cycling, I enjoy exploring the different regions of South Holland.
I live in the Hague, so I can go take the tram to go to the beach on Scheveningen or Kijkduin

The big short: I love the way this movie is shot, it is fast pased, energetic and a great depection of how the 2008 fincanial crisis came to be. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1
Margin call: I love the depicted dynamics of the people in this movie. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1615147/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1

Programming:

I enjoy trying to build new things in various lanauges, i previously build a checkers game in python. 
A genetic neural network which teaches cars to drive on a track. Tick tack toe using reinforcement learning. 
And this website using python and vue. 

My first programming language i ever learnt was R. Which i have come to realize later on is not that great of a language (even for data science) but i love it nonetheless. 

I currently have experience with:

python
r
html/css/js/vue
sql (postgres/mssqlserver)
nosql (redis/mongo)
docker
linux
ansible

I am also currently focused on learning:
